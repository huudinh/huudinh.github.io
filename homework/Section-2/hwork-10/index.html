        <h3>
            Write a script to calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) of a person, the formula is as follows
        </h3>
        <p>
            BMI (Body Mass Index): <br>
            BMI = mass (kg) / (height(m) x height(m)) <br>
            Note: you must do the conversion from cm to m before calculation
        </p>
        <p>
            And then based on the calculated BMI, tell them that they are:
            <ul>
                <li>Severely underweight if BMI < 16</li>
                <li>Underweight if BMI is between 16 and 18.5</li>
                <li>Normal if BMI is between 18.5 and 25 </li>
                <li>Overweight if BMI is between 25 and 30</li>
                <li>Obese if BMI is more than 30</li>
            </ul>
