            Write a script to show user a quiz with 4 choices, for example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            How many legs does a spider have?

            1. None
            
            2. 4 legs
            
            3. 8 legs
            
            4. 12 legs
            
            
            
            Then ask them to answer this quiz, if they enter an invalid choice, 'hahaha' for example, tell them it is invalid and ask them to enter their choice again:
            
            
            
            Invalide choice, the answer must be 1, 2, 3 or 4
            
            
            
            If the choice is valid, check the result, if the answer is not correct:
            
            
            
            Good luck next time
            
            
            
            If it is:
            
            
            
            Bravo, you are correct            
        </pre>
