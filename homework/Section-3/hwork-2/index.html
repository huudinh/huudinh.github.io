        <pre>
           
            Split String into Array
            Using type conversion from String to Array
            
            const s = ‘Hello beauty there’;
            const a = Array(s);
            console.log(a); // Result: [“Hello beauty there”]
            
            Might NOT be what a developer expects; sometimes what 
            they really want is
            
            const s = ‘Hello beauty there’;
            
            <Perform splitting>
            
            console.log(a); // Result: [“Hello”, “beauty”, “there”]

            Google ‘JS String splitting to Array’ to learn how to perform 
            this task. Write an example to demonstrate your learning.
