            Variable swap
            Swapping variable is to exchange the values of two variable 
            so that at the end, one variable contains the value of the other

            For example:

            let a = 5;
            let b = 6;
            console.log(a, b); // Result: 5 6

            <Perform swapping>

            console.log(a, b); // Result: 6 5
            

            Google ‘JS swap variables’ to learn about at least 2 ways 
            to perform this task, write at least 2 examples to demonstrate 
            you have acquired them, if you need hints, they are at
